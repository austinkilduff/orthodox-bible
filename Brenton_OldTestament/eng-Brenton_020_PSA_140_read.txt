Psalms.
Chapter 140.
A Psalm of David. O Lord, I have cried to thee; hear me: attend to the voice of my supplication, when I cry to thee. 
Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice. 
Set a watch, O Lord, on my mouth, and a strong door about my lips. 
Incline not my heart to evil things, to employ pretexts for sins, with men who work iniquity: and let me not unite with their choice ones. 
The righteous shall chasten me with mercy, and reprove me: but let not the oil of the sinner anoint my head: for yet shall my prayer also be in their pleasures. 
Their mighty ones have been swallowed up near the rock: they shall hear my words, for they are sweet. 
As a lump of earth is crushed upon the ground, our bones have been scattered by the mouth of the grave. 
For mine eyes are to thee, O Lord God: I have hoped in thee; take not away my life. 
Keep me from the snare which they have set for me, and from the stumbling-blocks of them that work iniquity. 
Sinners shall fall by their own net: I am alone until I shall escape.
