Song of Solomon.
Chapter 7.
Return, return, O Sunamite; return, return, and we will look at thee. What will ye see in the Sunamite? She comes as bands of armies. 
Thy steps are beautiful in shoes, O daughter of the prince: the joints of thy thighs are like chains, the work of the craftsman. 
Thy navel is as a turned bowl, not wanting liquor; thy belly is as a heap of wheat set about with lilies. 
Thy two breasts are as two twin fawns. 
Thy neck is as an ivory tower; thine eyes are as pools in Esebon, by the gates of the daughter of many: thy nose is as the tower of Libanus, looking toward Damascus. 
Thy head upon thee is as Carmel, and the curls of thy hair like scarlet; the king is bound in the galleries. 
How beautiful art thou, and how sweet art thou, my love! 
This is thy greatness in thy delights: thou wast made like a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters. 
I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of its high boughs: and now shall thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose as apples; 
and thy throat as good wine, going well with my kinsman, suiting my lips and teeth. 
I am my kinsman's, and his desire is toward me. 
Come, my kinsman, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages. 
Let us go early into the vineyards; let us see if the vine has flowered, if the blossoms have appeared, if the pomegranates have blossomed; there will I give thee my breasts. 
The mandrakes have given a smell, and at our doors are all kinds of choice fruits, new and old. O my kinsman, I have kept them for thee.
