Psalms.
Chapter 16.
A Prayer of David. Hearken, O Lord of my righteousness, attend to my petition; give ear to my prayer not uttered with deceitful lips. 
Let my judgment come forth from thy presence; let mine eyes behold righteousness. 
Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me by night; thou hast tried me as with fire, and unrighteousness has not been found in me: I am purposed that my mouth shall not speak amiss. 
As for the works of men, by the words of thy lips I have guarded myself from hard ways. 
Direct my steps in thy paths, that my steps slip not. 
I have cried, for thou heardest me, O God: incline thine ear to me, and hearken to my words. 
Shew the marvels of thy mercies, thou that savest them that hope in thee. 
Keep me as the apple of the eye from those that resist thy right hand: thou shalt screen me by the covering of thy wings, 
from the face of the ungodly that have afflicted me: mine enemies have compassed about my soul. 
They have enclosed themselves with their own fat: their mouth has spoken pride. 
They have now cast me out and compassed me round about: they have set their eyes so as to bow them down to the ground. 
They laid wait for me as a lion ready for prey, and like a lion's whelp dwelling in secret places. 
Arise, O Lord, prevent them, and cast them down: deliver my soul from the ungodly: draw thy sword, 
because of the enemies of thine hand: O Lord, destroy them from the earth; scatter them in their life, though their belly has been filled with thy hidden treasures: they have been satisfied with uncleanness, and have left the remnant of their possessions to their babes. 
But I shall appear in righteousness before thy face: I shall be satisfied when thy glory appears.
