Joel.
Chapter 3.
And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions. 
And on my servants and on my handmaids in those days will I pour out of my Spirit. 
And I will shew wonders in heaven, and upon the earth, blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke. 
The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and glorious day of the Lord come. 
And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved: for in mount Sion and in Jerusalem shall the saved one be as the Lord has said, and they that have glad tidings preached to them, whom the Lord has called.
