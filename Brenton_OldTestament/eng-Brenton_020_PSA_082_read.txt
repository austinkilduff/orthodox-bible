Psalms.
Chapter 82.
A Song of a Psalm for Asaph. 
O God, who shall be compared to thee? be not silent, neither be still, O God. 
For behold, thine enemies have made a noise; and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. 
Against thy people they have craftily imagined a device, and have taken counsel against thy saints. 
They have said, Come, and let us utterly destroy them out of the nation; and let the name of Israel be remembered no more at all. 
For they have taken counsel together with one consent: they have made a confederacy against thee; 
even the tents of the Idumeans, and the Ismaelites; Moab, and the Agarenes; 
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalec; the Philistines also, with them that dwell at Tyre. 
Yea, Assur too is come with them: they have become a help to the children of Lot. Pause. 
Do thou to them as to Madiam, and to Sisera; as to Jabin at the brook of Kison. 
They were utterly destroyed at Aendor: they became as dung for the earth. 
Make their princes as Oreb and Zeb, and Zebee and Salmana; even all their princes: 
who said, Let us take to ourselves the altar of God as an inheritance. 
O my God, make them as a wheel; as stubble before the face of the wind. 
As fire which shall burn up a wood, as the flame may consume the mountains; 
so shalt thou persecute them with thy tempest, and trouble them in thine anger. 
Fill their faces with dishonour; so shall they seek thy name, O Lord. 
Let them be ashamed and troubled for evermore; yea, let them be confounded and destroyed. 
And let them know that thy name is Lord; that thou alone art Most High over all the earth.
