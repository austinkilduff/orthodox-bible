Psalms.
Chapter 31.
A Psalm of instruction by David. Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. 
Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin, and in whose mouth there is no guile. 
Because I kept silence, my bones waxed old, from my crying all the day. 
For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: I became thoroughly miserable while a thorn was fastened in me. Pause. 
I acknowledged my sin, and hid not mine iniquity: I said, I will confess mine iniquity to the Lord against myself; and thou forgavest the ungodliness of my heart. Pause. 
Therefore shall every holy one pray to thee in a fit time: only in the deluge of many waters they shall not come nigh to him. 
Thou art my refuge from the affliction that encompasses me; my joy, to deliver me from them that have compassed me. Pause. 
I will instruct thee and guide thee in this way wherein thou shalt go: I will fix mine eyes upon thee. 
Be ye not as horse and mule, which have no understanding: but thou must constrain their jaws with bit and curb, lest they should come nigh to thee. 
Many are the scourges of the sinner: but him that hopes in the Lord mercy shall compass about. 
Be glad in the Lord, and exult, ye righteous: and glory, all ye that are upright in heart.
