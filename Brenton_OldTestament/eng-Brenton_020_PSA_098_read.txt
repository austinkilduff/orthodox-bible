Psalms.
Chapter 98.
A Psalm of David. The Lord reigns;—let the people rage; it is he that sits upon the cherubs, let the earth be moved. 
The Lord is great in Sion, and is high over all the people. 
Let them give thanks to thy great name; for it is terrible and holy. 
And the king's honour loves judgment; thou hast prepared equity, thou hast wrought judgment and justice in Jacob. 
Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy. 
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the Lord, and he heard them. 
He spoke to them in a pillar of cloud; they kept his testimonies, and the ordinances which he gave them. 
O Lord our God, thou heardest them; O God, thou becamest propitious to them, though thou didst take vengeance on all their devices. 
Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his holy mountain; for the Lord our God is holy.
