Psalms.
Chapter 60.
For the end, among the Hymns of David. 
O God, hearken to my petition; attend to my prayer. 
From the ends of the earth have I cried to thee, when my heart was in trouble: thou liftedst me up on a rock, thou didst guide me: 
because thou wert my hope, a tower of strength from the face of the enemy. 
I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever; I will shelter myself under the shadow of thy wings. Pause. 
For thou, O God, hast heard my prayers; thou hast given an inheritance to them that fear thy name. 
Thou shalt add days to the days of the king; thou shalt lengthen his years to all generations. 
He shall endure for ever before God: which of them will seek out his mercy and truth? 
So will I sing to thy name for ever and ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
