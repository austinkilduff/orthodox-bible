Psalms.
Chapter 120.
A Song of Degrees. I lifted up mine eyes to the mountains, whence my help shall come. 
My help shall come from the Lord, who made the heaven and the earth. 
Let not thy foot be moved; and let not thy keeper slumber. 
Behold, he that keeps Israel shall not slumber nor sleep. 
The Lord shall keep thee: the Lord is thy shelter upon thy right hand. 
The sun shall not burn thee by day, neither the moon by night. 
May the Lord preserve thee from all evil: the Lord shall keep thy soul. 
The Lord shall keep thy coming in, and thy going out, from henceforth and even for ever.
