Psalms.
Chapter 59.
For the end, for them that shall yet be changed; for an inscription by David for instruction, 
when he had burned Mesopotamia of Syria, and Syria Sobal, and Joab had returned and smitten in the valley of salt twelve thousand. 
O God, thou hast rejected and destroyed us; thou hast been angry, yet hast pitied us. 
Thou hast shaken the earth, and troubled it; heal its breaches, for it has been shaken. 
Thou hast shewn thy people hard things: thou hast made us drink the wine of astonishment. 
Thou hast given a token to them that fear thee, that they might flee from the bow. Pause. 
That thy beloved ones may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me. 
God has spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, and divide Sicima, and measure out the valley of tents. 
Galaad is mine, and Manasse is mine; and Ephraim is the strength of my head; 
Judas is my king; Moab is the caldron of my hope; over Idumea will I stretch out my shoe; the Philistines have been subjected to me. 
Who will lead me into the fortified city? who will guide me as far as Idumea? 
Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our forces? 
Give us help from trouble: for vain is the deliverance of man. 
In God will we do valiantly; and he shall bring to nought them that harass us.
