Esaias.
Chapter 12.
And in that day thou shalt say, I will bless thee, O Lord; for thou wast angry with me, but thou hast turned aside thy wrath, and hast pitied me. 
Behold, my God is my Saviour; I will trust in him, and not be afraid: for the Lord is my glory and my praise, and is become my salvation. 
Draw ye therefore water with joy out of the wells of salvation. 
And in that day thou shalt say, Sing to the Lord, call aloud upon his name, proclaim his glorious deeds among the Gentiles; make mention that his name is exalted. 
Sing praise to the name of the Lord; for he has done great things: declare this in all the earth. 
Exalt and rejoice, ye that dwell in Sion: for the Holy One of Israel is exalted in the midst of her.
