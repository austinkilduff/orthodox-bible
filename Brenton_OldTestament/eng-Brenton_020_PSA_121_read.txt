Psalms.
Chapter 121.
A Song of Degrees. I was glad when they said to me, Let us go into the house of the Lord. 
Our feet stood in thy courts, O Jerusalem. 
Jerusalem is built as a city whose fellowship is complete. 
For thither the tribes went up, the tribes of the Lord, as a testimony for Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord. 
For there are set thrones for judgment, even thrones for the house of David. 
Pray now for the peace of Jerusalem: and let there be prosperity to them that love thee. 
Let peace, I pray, be within thine host, and prosperity in thy palaces. 
For the sake of my brethren and my neighbours, I have indeed spoken peace concerning thee. 
Because of the house of the Lord our God, I have diligently sought thy good.
