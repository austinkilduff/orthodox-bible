Psalms.
Chapter 42.
A Psalm of David. Judge me, O God, and plead my cause, against an ungodly nation: deliver me from the unjust and crafty man. 
For thou, O God, art my strength: wherefore hast thou cast me off? and why do I go sad of countenance, while the enemy oppresses me? 
Send forth thy light and thy truth: they have led me, and brought me to thy holy mountain, and to thy tabernacles. 
And I will go in to the altar of God, to God who gladdens my youth: I will give thanks to thee on the harp, O God, my God. 
Wherefore art thou very sad, O my soul? and wherefore dost thou trouble me? Hope in God; for I will give thanks to him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.
