Psalms.
Chapter 90.
Praise of a Song, by David. He that dwells in the help of the Highest, shall sojourn under the shelter of the God of heaven. 
He shall say to the Lord, Thou art my helper and my refuge: my God; I will hope in him. 
For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunters, from every troublesome matter. 
He shall overshadow thee with his shoulders, and thou shalt trust under his wings: his truth shall cover thee with a shield. 
Thou shalt not be afraid of terror by night; nor of the arrow flying by day; 
nor of the evil thing that walks in darkness; nor of calamity, and the evil spirit at noon-day. 
A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. 
Only with thine eyes shalt thou observe and see the reward of sinners. 
For thou, O Lord, art my hope: thou, my soul, hast made the Most High thy refuge. 
No evils shall come upon thee, and no scourge shall draw nigh to thy dwelling. 
For he shall give his angels charge concerning thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. 
They shall bear thee up on their hands, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. 
Thou shalt tread on the asp and basilisk: and thou shalt trample on the lion and dragon. 
For he has hoped in me, and I will deliver him: I will protect him, because he has known my name. 
He shall call upon me, and I will hearken to him: I am with him in affliction; and I will deliver him, and glorify him. 
I will satisfy him with length of days, and shew him my salvation.
