Psalms.
Chapter 62.
A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Idumea. 
O God, my God, I cry to thee early; my soul has thirsted for thee: how often has my flesh longed after thee, in a barren and trackless and dry land! 
Thus have I appeared before thee in the sanctuary, that I might see thy power and thy glory. 
For thy mercy is better than life: my lips shall praise thee. 
Thus will I bless thee during my life: I will lift up my hands in thy name. 
Let my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness; and my joyful lips shall praise thy name. 
Forasmuch as I have remembered thee on my bed: in the early seasons I have meditated on thee. 
For thou hast been my helper, and in the shelter of thy wings will I rejoice. 
My soul has kept very close behind thee: thy right hand has upheld me. 
But they vainly sought after my soul; they shall go into the lowest parts of the earth. 
They shall be delivered up to the power of the sword; they shall be portions for foxes. 
But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that swears by him shall be praised; for the mouth of them that speak unjust things has been stopped.
