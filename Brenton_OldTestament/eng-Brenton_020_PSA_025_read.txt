Psalms.
Chapter 25.
A Psalm of David. Judge me, O Lord; for I have walked in my innocence: and hoping in the Lord I shall not be moved. 
Prove me, O Lord, and try me; purify as with fire my reins and my heart. 
For thy mercy is before mine eyes: and I am well pleased with thy truth. 
I have not sat with the council of vanity, and will in nowise enter in with transgressors. 
I have hated the assembly of wicked doers; and will not sit with ungodly men. 
I will wash my hands in innocency, and compass thine altar, O Lord: 
to hear the voice of praise, and to declare all thy wonderful works. 
O Lord, I have loved the beauty of thy house, and the place of the tabernacle of thy glory. 
Destroy not my soul together with the ungodly, nor my life with bloody men: 
in whose hands are iniquities, and their right hand is filled with bribes. 
But I have walked in my innocence: redeem me, and have mercy upon me. 
My foot stands in an even place: in the congregations will I bless thee, O Lord.
