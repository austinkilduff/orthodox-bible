Psalms.
Chapter 109.
A Psalm of David. The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. 
The Lord shall send out a rod of power for thee out of Sion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. 
With thee is dominion in the day of thy power, in the splendours of thy saints: I have begotten thee from the womb before the morning. 
The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec. 
The Lord at thy right hand has dashed in pieces kings in the day of his wrath. 
He shall judge among the nations, he shall fill up the number of corpses, he shall crush the heads of many on the earth. 
He shall drink of the brook in the way; therefore shall he lift up the head.
