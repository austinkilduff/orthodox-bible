Psalms.
Chapter 6.
For the end, a Psalm of David among the Hymns for the eighth. 
O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath, neither chasten me in thine anger. 
Pity me, O Lord; for I am weak: heal me, O Lord; for my bones are vexed. 
My soul also is grievously vexed: but thou, O Lord, how long? 
Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: save me for thy mercy's sake. 
For in death no man remembers thee: and who will give thee thanks in Hades? 
I am wearied with my groaning; I shall wash my bed every night; I shall water my couch with my tears. 
Mine eye is troubled because of my wrath; I am worn out because of all my enemies. 
Depart from me, all ye that work iniquity; for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping. 
The Lord has hearkened to my petition; the Lord has accepted my prayer. 
Let all mine enemies be put to shame and sore troubled: let them be turned back and grievously put to shame speedily.
