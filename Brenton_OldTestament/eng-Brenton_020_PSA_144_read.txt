Psalms.
Chapter 144.
David's Psalm of praise. I will exalt thee, my God, my king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever. 
Every day will I bless thee, and I will praise thy name for ever and ever. 
The Lord is great, and greatly to be praised; and there is no end of his greatness. 
Generation after generation shall praise thy works, and tell of thy power. 
And they shall speak of the glorious majesty of thy holiness, and recount thy wonders. 
And they shall speak of the power of thy terrible acts; and recount thy greatness. 
They shall utter the memory of the abundance of thy goodness, and shall exult in thy righteousness. 
The Lord is compassionate, and merciful; long-suffering, and abundant in mercy. 
The Lord is good to those that wait on him; and his compassions are over all his works. 
Let all thy works, O Lord, give thanks to thee; and let thy saints bless thee. 
They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy dominion; 
to make known to the sons of men thy power, and the glorious majesty of thy kingdom. 
Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endures through all generations. 
The Lord is faithful in his words, and holy in all his works. 
The Lord supports all that are falling, and sets up all that are broken down. 
The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their food in due season. 
Thou openest thine hands, and fillest every living thing with pleasure. 
The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works. 
The Lord is near to all that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth. 
He will perform the desire of them that fear him: and he will hear their supplication, and save them. 
The Lord preserves all that love him: but all sinners he will utterly destroy. 
My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
