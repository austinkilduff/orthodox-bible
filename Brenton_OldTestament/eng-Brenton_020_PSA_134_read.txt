Psalms.
Chapter 134.
Alleluia. Praise ye the name of the Lord; praise the Lord, ye his servants, 
who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God. 
Praise ye the Lord; for the Lord is good: sing praises to his name; for it is good. 
For the Lord has chosen Jacob for himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure. 
For I know that the Lord is great, and our Lord is above all gods; 
all that the Lord willed, he did in heaven, and on the earth, in the sea, and in all deeps. 
Who brings up clouds from the extremity of the earth: he has made lightnings for the rain: he brings winds out of his treasures. 
Who smote the first-born of Egypt, both of man and beast. 
He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, on Pharao, and on all his servants. 
Who smote many nations, and slew mighty kings; 
Seon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Basan, and all the kingdoms of Chanaan: 
and gave their land for an inheritance, an inheritance to Israel his people. 
O Lord, thy name endures for ever, and thy memorial to all generations. 
For the Lord shall judge his people, and comfort himself concerning his servants. 
The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the works of men's hands. 
They have a mouth, but they cannot speak; they have eyes, but they cannot see; 
they have ears, but they cannot hear; for there is no breath in their mouth. 
Let those who make them be made like to them; and all those who trust in them. 
O house of Israel, bless ye the Lord: O house of Aaron, bless ye the Lord: 
O house of Levi, bless ye the Lord: ye that fear the Lord, bless the Lord. 
Blessed in Sion be the Lord, who dwells in Jerusalem.
