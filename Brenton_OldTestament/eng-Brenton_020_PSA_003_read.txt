Psalms.
Chapter 3.
A Psalm of David, when he fled from the presence of his son Abessalom. 
O Lord, why are they that afflict me multiplied? many rise up against me. 
Many say concerning my soul, There is no deliverance for him in his God. Pause. 
But thou, O Lord, art my helper: my glory, and the one that lifts up my head. 
I cried to the Lord with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy mountain. Pause. 
I lay down and slept; I awaked; for the Lord will help me. 
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, who beset me round about. 
Arise, Lord; deliver me, my God: for thou hast smitten all who were without cause mine enemies; thou hast broken the teeth of sinners. 
Deliverance is the Lord's, and thy blessing is upon thy people.
