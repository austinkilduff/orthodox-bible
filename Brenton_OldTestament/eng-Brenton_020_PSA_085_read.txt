Psalms.
Chapter 85.
A Prayer of David. O Lord, incline thine ear, and hearken to me; for I am poor and needy. 
Preserve my soul, for I am holy; save thy servant, O God, who hopes in thee. 
Pity me, O Lord: for to thee will I cry all the day. 
Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for to thee, O Lord, have I lifted up my soul. 
For thou, O Lord, art kind, and gentle; and plenteous in mercy to all that call upon thee. 
Give ear to my prayer, O Lord; and attend to the voice of my supplication. 
In the day of my trouble I cried to thee: for thou didst hear me. 
There is none like to thee, O Lord, among the gods; and there are no works like to thy works. 
All nations whom thou hast made shall come, and shall worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name. 
For thou art great, and doest wonders: thou art the only and the great God. 
Guide me, O Lord, in thy way, and I will walk in thy truth: let my heart rejoice, that I may fear thy name. 
I will give thee thanks, O Lord my God, with all my heart; and I will glorify thy name for ever. 
For thy mercy is great toward me; and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell. 
O God, transgressors have risen up against me, and an assembly of violent men have sought my life; and have not set thee before them. 
But thou, O Lord God, art compassionate and merciful, long-suffering, and abundant in mercy and true. 
Look thou upon me, and have mercy upon me: give thy strength to thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid. 
Establish with me a token for good; and let them that hate me see it and be ashamed; because thou, O Lord, hast helped me, and comforted me.
