Psalms.
Chapter 19.
For the end, a Psalm of David. 
The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee. 
Send thee help from the sanctuary, and aid thee out of Sion. 
Remember all thy sacrifice, and enrich thy whole-burnt-offering. Pause. 
Grant thee according to thy heart, and fulfil all thy desire. 
We will exult in thy salvation, and in the name of our God shall we be magnified: the Lord fulfil all thy petitions. 
Now I know that the Lord has saved his Christ: he shall hear him from his holy heaven: the salvation of his right hand is mighty. 
Some glory in chariots, and some in horses: but we will glory in the name of the Lord our God. 
They are overthrown and fallen: but we are risen, and have been set upright. 
O Lord, save the king: and hear us in whatever day we call upon thee.
