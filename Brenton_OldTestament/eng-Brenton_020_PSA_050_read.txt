Psalms.
Chapter 50.
For the end, a Psalm of David, 
when Nathan the prophet came to him, when he had gone in to Bersabee. 
Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy great mercy; and according to the multitude of thy compassions blot out my transgression. 
Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. 
For I am conscious of mine iniquity; and my sin is continually before me. 
Against thee only have I sinned, and done evil before thee: that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged. 
For, behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my mother conceive me. 
For, behold, thou lovest truth: thou hast manifested to me the secret and hidden things of thy wisdom. 
Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be purified: thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow. 
Thou shalt cause me to hear gladness and joy: the afflicted bones shall rejoice. 
Turn away thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. 
Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit in my inward parts. 
Cast me not away from thy presence; and remove not thy Holy Spirit from me. 
Restore to me the joy of thy salvation: establish me with thy directing Spirit. 
Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and ungodly men shall turn to thee. 
Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation: and my tongue shall joyfully declare thy righteousness. 
O Lord, thou shalt open my lips; and my mouth shall declare thy praise. 
For if thou desiredst sacrifice, I would have given it: thou wilt not take pleasure in whole-burnt-offerings. 
Sacrifice to God is a broken spirit: a broken and humbled heart God will not despise. 
Do good, O Lord, to Sion in thy good pleasure; and let the walls of Jerusalem be built. 
Then shalt thou be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, offering, and whole-burnt-sacrifices: then shall they offer calves upon thine altar.
