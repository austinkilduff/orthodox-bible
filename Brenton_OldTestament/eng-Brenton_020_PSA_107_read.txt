Psalms.
Chapter 107.
Song of a Psalm by David. 
O God, my heart is ready, my heart is ready; I will sing and sing psalms with my glory. 
Awake, psaltery and harp; I will awake early. 
I will give thanks to thee, O Lord, among the people; I will sing praise to thee among the Gentiles. 
For thy mercy is great above the heavens, and thy truth reaches to the clouds. 
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; and thy glory above all the earth. 
That thy beloved ones may be delivered, save with thy right hand, and hear me. God has spoken in his sanctuary; 
I will be exalted, and will divide Sicima, and will measure out the valley of tents. 
Galaad is mine; and Manasses is mine; and Ephraim is the help of mine head; Judas is my king; 
Moab is the caldron of my hope; over Idumea will I cast my sandal; the Philistines are made subject to me. 
Who will bring me into the fortified city? or who will guide me to Idumea? 
Wilt not thou, O God, who hast rejected us? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts? 
Give us help from tribulation: for vain is the help of man. 
Through God we shall do valiantly; and he will bring to nought our enemies.
