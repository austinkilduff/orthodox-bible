Psalms.
Chapter 129.
A Song of Degrees. Out of the depths have I cried to thee, O Lord. 
O Lord, hearken to my voice; let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication. 
If thou, O Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? 
For with thee is forgiveness: for thy name's sake 
have I waited for thee, O Lord, my soul has waited for thy word. 
My soul has hoped in the Lord; from the morning watch till night. 
Let Israel hope in the Lord: for with the Lord is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption. 
And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
