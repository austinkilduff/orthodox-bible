Jezekiel.
Chapter 35.
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 
Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it, 
and say to it, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against thee, O mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and will make thee a waste, and thou shalt be made desolate. 
And I will cause desolation in thy cities, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. 
Because thou hast been a perpetual enemy, and hast laid wait craftily for the house of Israel, with the hand of enemies with a sword, in the time of injustice, at the last: 
Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord God, verily thou hast sinned even to blood, therefore blood shall pursue thee. 
And I will make mount Seir a waste, and desolate, and I will destroy from off it men and cattle: 
and I will fill thy hills and thy valleys with slain men, and in all thy plains there shall fall in thee men slain with the sword. 
I will make thee a perpetual desolation, and thy cities shall not be inhabited any more: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. 
Because thou saidst, The two nations and the two countries shall be mine, and I shall inherit them; whereas the Lord is there: 
therefore, as I live, saith the Lord, I will even deal with thee according to thine enmity, and I will be made known to thee when I shall judge thee: 
and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. I have heard the voice of thy blasphemies, whereas thou hast said, The desert mountains of Israel are given to us for food; 
and thou hast spoken swelling words against me with thy mouth: I have heard them. 
Thus saith the Lord; When all the earth is rejoicing, I will make thee desert. 
Thou shalt be desert, O mount Seir, and all Idumea; and it shall be utterly consumed: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord their God.
