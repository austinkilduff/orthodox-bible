Psalms.
Chapter 115.
Alleluia. I believed, wherefore I have spoken: but I was greatly afflicted. 
And I said in mine amazement, Every man is a liar. 
What shall I render to the Lord for all the things wherein he has rewarded me? 
I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord. 
I will pay my vows to the Lord, in the presence of all his people. 
Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. 
O Lord, I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast burst my bonds asunder. 
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of praise, and will call upon the name of the Lord. 
I will pay my vows unto the Lord, in the presence of all his people, 
in the courts of the Lord's house, in the midst of thee, Jerusalem.
