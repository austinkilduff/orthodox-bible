Psalms.
Chapter 64.
For the end, a Psalm and Song of David. 
Praise becomes thee, O God, in Sion; and to thee shall the vow be performed. 
Hear my prayer; to thee all flesh shall come. 
The words of transgressors have overpowered us; but do thou pardon our sins. 
Blessed is he whom thou hast chosen and adopted; he shall dwell in thy courts; we shall be filled with the good things of thy house; thy temple is holy. 
Thou art wonderful in righteousness. Hearken to us, O God our Saviour; the hope of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are on the sea afar off: 
who dost establish the mountains in thy strength, being girded about with power; 
who troublest the depth of the sea, the sounds of its waves. 
The nations shall be troubled, and they that inhabit the ends of the earth shall be afraid of thy signs; thou wilt cause the outgoings of morning and evening to rejoice. 
Thou hast visited the earth, and saturated it; thou hast abundantly enriched it. The river of God is filled with water; thou hast prepared their food, for thus is the preparation of it. 
Saturate her furrows, multiply her fruits; the crop springing up shall rejoice in its drops. 
Thou wilt bless the crown of the year because of thy goodness; and thy plains shall be filled with fatness. 
The mountains of the wilderness shall be enriched; and the hills shall gird themselves with joy. 
The rams of the flock are clothed with wool, and the valleys shall abound in corn; they shall cry aloud, yea they shall sing hymns.
