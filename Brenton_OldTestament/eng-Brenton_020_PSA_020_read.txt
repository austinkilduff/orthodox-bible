Psalms.
Chapter 20.
For the end, a Psalm of David. 
O Lord, the king shall rejoice in thy strength; and in thy salvation he shall greatly exult. 
Thou hast granted him the desire of his soul, and hast not withheld from him the request of his lips. Pause. 
For thou hast prevented him with blessings of goodness: thou hast set upon his head a crown of precious stone. 
He asked life of thee, and thou gavest him length of days for ever and ever. 
His glory is great in thy salvation: thou wilt crown him with glory and majesty. 
For thou wilt give him a blessing for ever and ever: thou wilt gladden him with joy with thy countenance. 
For the king trusts in the Lord, and through the mercy of the Highest he shall not be moved. 
Let thy hand be found by all thine enemies: let thy right hand find all that hate thee. 
Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven at the time of thy presence: the Lord shall trouble them in his anger, and fire shall devour them. 
Thou shalt destroy their fruit from the earth, and their seed from among the sons of men. 
For they intended evils against thee; they imagined a device which they shall by no means be able to perform. 
For thou shalt make them turn their back in thy latter end, thou wilt prepare their face. 
Be thou exalted, O Lord, in thy strength: we will sing and praise thy mighty acts.
