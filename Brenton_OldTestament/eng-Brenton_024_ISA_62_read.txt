Esaias.
Chapter 62.
For Sion's sake I will not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until her righteousness go forth as light, and my salvation burn as a torch. 
And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and kings thy glory: and one shall call thee by a new name, which the Lord shall name. 
And thou shalt be a crown of beauty in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. 
And thou shalt no more be called Forsaken; and thy land shall no more be called Desert: for thou shalt be called My Pleasure, and thy land Inhabited: for the Lord has taken pleasure in thee, and thy land shall be inhabited. 
And as a young man lives with a virgin, so shall thy sons dwell in thee: and it shall come to pass that as a bridegroom will rejoice over a bride, so will the Lord rejoice over thee. 
And on thy walls, O Jerusalem, have I set watchmen all day and all night, who shall never cease making mention of the Lord. 
For there is none like you, when he shall have established, and made Jerusalem a praise on the earth. 
For the Lord has sworn by his glory, and by the might of his arm, I will no more give thy corn and thy provisions to thine enemies; nor shall strangers any more drink thy wine, for which thou hast laboured. 
But they that have gathered them shall eat them, and they shall praise the Lord; and they that have gathered the grapes shall drink thereof in my holy courts. 
Go through my gates, and make a way for my people; and cast the stones out of the way; lift up a standard for the Gentiles. 
For behold, the Lord has proclaimed to the end of the earth, say ye to the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy Saviour has come to thee, having his reward and his work before his face. 
And one shall call them the holy people, the redeemed of the Lord: and thou shalt be called a city sought out, and not forsaken.
