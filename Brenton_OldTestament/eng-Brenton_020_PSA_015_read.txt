Psalms.
Chapter 15.
A writing of David. Keep me, O Lord; for I have hoped in thee. 
I said to the Lord, Thou art my Lord; for thou hast no need of my goodness. 
On behalf of the saints that are in his land, he has magnified all his pleasure in them. 
Their weaknesses have been multiplied; afterward they hasted. I will by no means assemble their bloody meetings, neither will I make mention of their names with my lips. 
The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou art he that restores my inheritance to me. 
The lines have fallen to me in the best places, yea, I have a most excellent heritage. 
I will bless the Lord who has instructed me; my reins too have chastened me even till night. 
I foresaw the Lord always before my face; for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved. 
Therefore my heart rejoiced and my tongue exulted; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope: 
because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. 
Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou wilt fill me with joy with thy countenance: at thy right hand there are delights for ever.
