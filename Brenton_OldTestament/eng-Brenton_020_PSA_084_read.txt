Psalms.
Chapter 84.
For the end, a Psalm for the sons of Core. 
O Lord, thou hast taken pleasure in thy land: thou hast turned back the captivity of Jacob. 
Thou hast forgiven thy people their transgressions; thou hast covered all their sins. Pause. 
Thou hast caused all thy wrath to cease: thou hast turned from thy fierce anger. 
Turn us, O God of our salvation, and turn thine anger away from us. 
Wouldest thou be angry with us for ever? or wilt thou continue thy wrath from generation to generation? 
O God, thou wilt turn and quicken us; and thy people shall rejoice in thee. 
Shew us thy mercy, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation. 
I will hear what the Lord God will say concerning me: for he shall speak peace to his people, and to his saints, and to those that turn their heart toward him. 
Moreover his salvation is near them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land. 
Mercy and truth are met together: righteousness and peace have kissed each other. 
Truth has sprung out of the earth; and righteousness has looked down from heaven. 
For the Lord will give goodness; and our land shall yield her fruit. 
Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set his steps in the way.
