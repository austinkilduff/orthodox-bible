Psalms.
Chapter 27.
A Psalm of David. To thee, O Lord, have I cried; my God, be not silent toward me: lest thou be silent toward me, and so I should be likened to them that go down to the pit. 
Hearken to the voice of my supplication, when I pray to thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy temple. 
Draw not away my soul with sinners, and destroy me not with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace with their neighbours, but evils are in their hearts. 
Give them according to their works, and according to the wickedness of their devices: give them according to the works of their hands; render their recompence unto them. 
Because they have not attended to the works of the Lord, even to the works of his hands, thou shalt pull them down, and shalt not build them up. 
Blessed be the Lord, for he has hearkened to the voice of my petition. 
The Lord is my helper and my defender; my heart has hoped in him, and I am helped: my flesh has revived, and willingly will I give praise to him. 
The Lord is the strength of his people, and the saving defender of his anointed. 
Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: and take care of them, and lift them up for ever.
