Psalms.
Chapter 32.
A Psalm of David. Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous; praise becomes the upright. 
Praise the Lord on the harp; play to him on a psaltery of ten strings. 
Sing to him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise. 
For the word of the Lord is right; and all his works are faithful. 
He loves mercy and judgment; the earth is full of the mercy of the Lord. 
By the word of the Lord the heavens were established; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. 
Who gathers the waters of the sea as in a bottle; who lays up the deeps in treasuries. 
Let all the earth fear the Lord; and let all that dwell in the world be moved because of him. 
For he spoke, and they were made; he commanded, and they were created. 
The Lord frustrates the counsels of the nations; he brings to nought also the reasonings of the peoples, and brings to nought the counsels of princes. 
But the counsel of the Lord endures for ever, the thoughts of his heart from generation to generation. 
Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord; the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance. 
The Lord looks out of heaven; he beholds all the sons of men. 
He looks from his prepared habitation on all the dwellers on the earth; 
who fashioned their hearts alone; who understands all their works. 
A king is not saved by reason of a great host; and a giant shall not be delivered by the greatness of his strength. 
A horse is vain for safety; neither shall he be delivered by the greatness of his power. 
Behold, the eyes of the Lord are on them that fear him, those that hope in his mercy; 
to deliver their souls from death, and to keep them alive in famine. 
Our soul waits on the Lord; for he is our helper and defender. 
For our heart shall rejoice in him, and we have hoped in his holy name. 
Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, according as we have hoped in thee.
