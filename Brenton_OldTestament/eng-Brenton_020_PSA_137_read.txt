Psalms.
Chapter 137.
A Psalm for David, of Aggæus and Zacharias. I will give thee thanks, O Lord, with my whole heart; and I will sing psalms to thee before the angels; for thou hast heard all the words of my mouth. 
I will worship toward thy holy temple, and give thanks to thy name, on account of thy mercy and thy truth; for thou hast magnified thy holy name above every thing. 
In whatsoever day I shall call upon thee, hear me speedily; thou shalt abundantly provide me with thy power in my soul. 
Let all the kings of the earth, O Lord, give thanks unto thee; for they have heard all the words of thy mouth. 
And let them sing in the ways of the Lord; for great is the glory of the Lord. 
For the Lord is high, and yet regards the lowly; and he knows high things from afar off. 
Though I should walk in the midst of affliction, thou wilt quicken me; thou hast stretched forth thine hands against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand has saved me. 
O Lord, thou shalt recompense them on my behalf: thy mercy, O Lord, endures for ever: overlook not the works of thine hands.
