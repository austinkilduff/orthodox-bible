Psalms.
Chapter 92.
For the day before the Sabbath, when the land was first inhabited, the praise of a Song by David. The Lord reigns; he has clothed himself with honour: the Lord has clothed and girded himself with strength; for he has established the world, which shall not be moved. 
Thy throne is prepared of old: thou art from everlasting. 
The rivers have lifted up, O Lord, the rivers have lifted up their voices, 
at the voices of many waters: the billows of the sea are wonderful: the Lord is wonderful in high places. 
Thy testimonies are made very sure: holiness becomes thine house, O Lord, for ever.
