Psalms.
Chapter 80.
For the end, a Psalm for Asaph, concerning the wine-presses. 
Rejoice ye in God our helper; shout aloud to the God of Jacob. 
Take a psalm, and produce the timbrel, the pleasant psaltery with the harp. 
Blow the trumpet at the new moon, in the glorious day of your feast. 
For this is an ordinance for Israel, and a statute of the God of Jacob. 
He made it to be a testimony in Joseph, when he came forth out of the land of Egypt: he heard a language which he understood not. 
He removed his back from burdens: his hands slaved in making the baskets. 
Thou didst call upon me in trouble, and I delivered thee; I heard thee in the secret place of the storm: I proved thee at the water of Strife. Pause. 
Hear, my people, and I will speak to thee, O Israel; and I will testify to thee: if thou wilt hearken to me; 
there shall be no new god in thee; neither shalt thou worship a strange god. 
For I am the Lord thy God, that brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. 
But my people hearkened not to my voice; and Israel gave no heed to me. 
So I let them go after the ways of their own hearts: they will go on in their own ways. 
If my people had hearkened to me, if Israel had walked in my ways, 
I should have put down their enemies very quickly, and should have laid my hand upon those that afflicted them. 
The Lord's enemies should have lied to him: but their time shall be for ever. 
And he fed them with the fat of wheat; and satisfied them with honey out of the rock.
