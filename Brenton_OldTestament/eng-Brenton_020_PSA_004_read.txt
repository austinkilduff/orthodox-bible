Psalms.
Chapter 4.
For the end, a Song of David among the Psalms. 
When I called upon him, the God of my righteousness heard me: thou hast made room for me in tribulation; pity me, and hearken to my prayer. 
O ye sons of men, how long will ye be slow of heart? wherefore do ye love vanity, and seek falsehood? Pause. 
But know ye that the Lord has done wondrous things for his holy one: the Lord will hear me when I cry to him. 
Be ye angry, and sin not; feel compunction upon your beds for what ye say in your hearts. Pause. 
Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, and trust in the Lord. 
Many say, Who will shew us good things? the light of thy countenance, O Lord, has been manifested towards us. 
Thou hast put gladness into my heart: they have been satisfied with the fruit of their corn and wine and oil. 
I will both lie down in peace and sleep: for thou, Lord, only hast caused me to dwell securely.
