Psalms.
Chapter 114.
Alleluia. I am well pleased, because the Lord will hearken to the voice of my supplication. 
Because he has inclined his ear to me, therefore will I call upon him while I live. 
The pangs of death compassed me; the dangers of hell found me: I found affliction and sorrow. 
Then I called on the name of the Lord: O Lord, deliver my soul. 
The Lord is merciful and righteous; yea, our God has pity. 
The Lord preserves the simple: I was brought low, and he delivered me. 
Return to thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord has dealt bountifully with thee. 
For he has delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. 
I shall be well-pleasing before the Lord in the land of the living.
