Psalms.
Chapter 8.
For the end, concerning the wine-presses, a Psalm of David. 
O Lord, our Lord, how wonderful is thy name in all the earth! for thy magnificence is exalted above the heavens. 
Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou perfected praise, because of thine enemies; that thou mightest put down the enemy and avenger. 
For I will regard the heavens, the work of thy fingers; the moon and stars, which thou hast established. 
What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him? 
Thou madest him a little less than angels, thou hast crowned him with glory and honour; 
and thou hast set him over the works of thy hands: thou hast put all things under his feet: 
sheep and all oxen, yea, and the cattle of the field; 
the birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea, the creatures passing through the paths of the sea. 
O Lord our Lord, how wonderful is thy name in all the earth!
