Psalms.
Chapter 127.
A Song of Degrees. Blessed are all they that fear the Lord; who walk in his ways. 
Thou shalt eat the labours of thy hands: blessed art thou, and it shall be well with thee. 
Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine on the sides of thy house: thy children as young olive-plants round about thy table. 
Behold, thus shall the man be blessed that fears the Lord. 
May the Lord bless thee out of Sion; and mayest thou see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. 
And mayest thou see thy children's children. Peace be upon Israel.
